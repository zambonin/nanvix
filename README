WHAT IS NANVIX?

	Nanvix is a Unix-like operating system written by Pedro H. Penna for
	educational purposes. It is designed to be simple and small, but also
	modern and fully featured.

WHAT HARDWARE IS REQUIRED?

	Nanvix targets 32-bit x86-based PCs and only requires a floppy or
	CD-ROM drive and 16 MB of RAM. You can run it either in a real PC
	or in a virtual machine, from a Live System's Image, available
	at: sourceforge.net/projects/nanvix/files/

BUILDING

	In order to build Nanvix, you will need a Linux like programming
	environment, the x86 GCC compiler and the x86 GNU binutils.

	Edit the `tools/dev/setup-*` scripts according to your package
	manager, and run

		# make prepare

	to build the Nanvix toolchain. This command will also create the
	following rule, that can be used to clean the installed toolchain files.

		# make clean-toolchain

	Once you have setup the required tools, you should set the
	environment variable $TARGET to point to the toolchain's directory.

	When done, you can build Nanvix by typing, at the root directory:

		$ make nanvix

	Or you can build a Live System's Image by typing, at the same directory:

		# make image

	Note that for building a image you may require privileged access.

	To run the final product using BOCHS, type

		# make run
